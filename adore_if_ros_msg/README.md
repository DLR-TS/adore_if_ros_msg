## Message definitions for ROS interface of adore
In order to communicate with ADORe in ROS this package should be used. By separating adore_if_ros and adore_if_ros_msg, interacting components are independent from adore source code.
Message types from common_msgs and std_msgs are preferredly employed for communication with external modules. 
Internal messages will be mainly specified as user defined messages.
All message headers shall be time-stamped with the true UTC time from the GPS module (or simulation equivalent).
